# 11056 Assessment 3
# Project 2: Outside the Grid
# Isabelle Dickson U3203200

For the second project in this unit, I found myself being able to create aspects of html and css with more ease than in the previous assessment. I decided to base my website on a videogame that I have been playing for many years, Guild Wars 2. I wanted to create a webpage briefly exploring the new elements that were included in the latest expansion pack released for the game. This page was inspired by the offical Guild Wars 2: End Of Dragons website, and was created to be a more simplieifed version of the inital complex website. This original Guild Wars 2 website is linked in my created project as the 'buy now' button, and is also mentioned in the footer. 

As this assessment was designed to be simple, I did not include a variety of elements, but instead chose to display the information via images. 
When starting this assessment, I initally wanted to create the website using Bootstrap, but asfter some issues regarding AI generation and css linking issues, I instead chose to use the Foundation Front-End Framework. 
Some of the code featured in this project was copied from the previous assessment, as some image elements were difficult to manipulate on completely fresh code, and instead required previous troubleshooting solutions. 

For this website I used W3schools and StackOverflow to assist with any unfamiliar problems that occured. The original websites for the images found in this project can be found at the bottom of this markdown.
